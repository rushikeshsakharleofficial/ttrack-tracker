# Ansible Tracking

ttrack can record Ansible playbook runs on the **controller** host (the machine running `ansible-playbook`). Each run is stored encrypted in the central store alongside terminal sessions, browsable with `ttrack ansible list` / `ttrack ansible show`.

## How it works

```
ansible-playbook (controller)
  └─ ttrack callback plugin (/usr/share/ttrack/ansible/ttrack.py)
       └─ pipes JSON-lines events to: ttrack ansible-ingest (subprocess)
            └─ connects to ttrackd over /run/ttrackd.sock
                 └─ ttrackd encrypts + writes
                      /var/lib/ttrack/<user>/ansible/<runid>.ajsonl
```

Events captured per run: `run` (metadata), `play`, `task` (per host: module, status, rc, stdout/stderr), `stats`.

## Enable the callback plugin

**Via environment variables (per-run):**

```bash
export ANSIBLE_CALLBACK_PLUGINS=/usr/share/ttrack/ansible
export ANSIBLE_CALLBACKS_ENABLED=ttrack
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

**Via `ansible.cfg` (persistent):**

```ini
[defaults]
callback_plugins  = /usr/share/ttrack/ansible
callbacks_enabled = ttrack
```

The plugin is installed at `/usr/share/ttrack/ansible/ttrack.py` by the deb/rpm packages.

## Browse runs

```bash
sudo ttrack ansible list
```

```

PLAY [Install web server]
  ✓  web1   install nginx           ansible.builtin.dnf       @14:03:01
  ~  web1   configure nginx         ansible.builtin.template  @14:03:04  (changed)
  ✓  web2   install nginx           ansible.builtin.dnf       @14:03:01
  ✗  web2   fail intentionally      ansible.builtin.command   @14:03:09
      rc: 1
      stderr: /usr/bin/false: intentional failure

PLAY RECAP
  web1   ok=8    changed=3   failed=0   unreachable=0   skipped=1
  web2   ok=6    changed=1   failed=1   unreachable=0   skipped=1
```

Status icons: `✓` = ok, `~` = changed, `✗` = failed, `!` = unreachable, `-` = skipped.

## Fail-open

If `ttrackd` is unreachable when the playbook runs, the run is saved locally to:

```
~/.local/share/ttrack/ansible/<runid>.ajsonl
```

The playbook is **never aborted** due to ttrack failures. The local file is ingested into the central store when `ttrackd` next starts.

## `no_log` tasks

Tasks with `no_log: true` are recorded with output replaced by `<censored>`:

```
  ✓  web1   rotate db password    ansible.builtin.command  @14:03:12
      stdout: <censored>
      stderr: <censored>
```

The task name, module, host, status, and rc are always recorded.

## Limitation

Only **controllers** with `ttrack` installed produce Ansible records. Managed hosts receive raw Ansible SSH execs. If the sshd `ForceCommand` wrapper is configured on managed hosts, those execs are captured as terminal sessions — but with no task name or status, just the raw `AnsiballZ_<module>.py` invocation.
