# Strategy (belt-and-suspenders):
# 1. Replace ttrack-ssh-wrap with a safe passthrough FIRST — so even if
#    sshd reload is delayed or the sshd config removal fails, any new SSH
#    connection will still work (just without recording).
# 2. Remove the sshd ForceCommand drop-in and reload sshd.
# 3. Remove the passthrough (dpkg removes the real binary next).
#
# This survives corrupt dpkg states, slow sshd reloads, and force-removes.
